# Netmatters HTML/CSS Reflection

This repository contains the source code and other notes and resources produced throughout the assignment.
I used HTML combined with SCSS/SASS to build this imitation website. I also used a HTML validator to check my markup.
Using SCSS allowed me to seperate styling rules into partials, which keep code organised and maintainable.
I reinforced and built upon the web development knowledge I learnt at university.
Some examples of newly learnt concepts include flexbox and the BEM (block__element-modifier) naming convention.
